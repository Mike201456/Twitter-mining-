# Twitter-mining-for-Uber-real-time-customer-satisfaction-survey

Recently, I am working a project using Twitter to conduct real-time customer satisfaction survey, I have done the following analysis:

· Collected tweets relevant to ”Uber” using the streaming API of Twitter. 

· Preprocessed tweets using Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK). 

· Applied machine learning algorithms for twitter sentiment analysis including Naive Bayes classifier, Multinomial classifier, Logistic regression, Linear SVM classifier, Random Forest classifier, Neuronetwork and AdaBoosting algorithm. 

· Analyzed and visualized the customer satisfaction rate by majority votes based on results from developed classifiers.

· If the customer satisfaction rate drops below expectation, I will apply LDA model to conduct topic modeling, and figure out what people are complaining at this time.
